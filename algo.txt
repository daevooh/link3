introduction 
project name:link3 
major function: onbodarding web2 projects into the blockchain ecosytem by
 granting the basic functionality that are available in the present web3 apps.(blockchain agnistic with sei)
Features: 1. Tokenization of the project[
    By incentivising basic funtions (of course based on the user specifiction). a. loggin in-streak 
    b. interacting with the contents of the site such as liking/ commenting of post in blogs alike.
    c. succefull purchases.
    d. sharing of contents.
    e. completing a profile.
    f. watching of videos 
2. smart smart contract integration.
3. token creation
4. Basic -- complex transaction handling.
]
How do we intend to carry out the bulk that makes the users want to integrate with us.[
    1. one line integration
    2. Tokenization layer.
    3. customisable rules.
    4. seemless wallet connection.
    5. analytics & control. 
    this would be huge for web2 project trying to Implement the ecosytem without the steep learning curve.

execution plan[
    1. backend(core infrastructure)
        a. API layer
        b. Database
        c. Blockchain Connector Write or review smart contracts for token creation, reward redemption, and API request verification.
        Optimize smart contracts for gas efficiency.
        d. Verification System.
    2. Frontend(streamlining User Flow)
        a. Dashboard for projects
        b. Token launch ui
        c. SDK
]
Section 1.1[
    Tokenization: reward users based on their reaction
    intrgration design: 
    a. the SDK acts as a bridgr betwwn the developer's application and your backend
    b. the developer's application will send input data(e.g, interaction type, user iD,e.t.c)
    c. backend processes the input, run it through a tokenization function, and update the user's token balance.
    tokenization logic:
    a. define a preset tokenization function that determines how many tokens are awarded for each type of interaction.
    b. function will be ccentralisd on your backend, ensuring consistency and security. 
    workflow:
    a. developer'application: the dev integrates my sdk into theirapplication.
    b. when the user performs an action(e.g, logs in, likes a post), the application calls the sdk with the relevant data
    SDK:
    a. the sdk forwards this data to my backend via an API call.
    BACKEND:
    a. your backend receives the datat and validates it(e.g check if the user exits)
    b. run it through the tokenisation functionto calculate the reward. 
    RESPONSE:
    a. the backend send a repose back to the sdk, which the developer's application can use to display the updated token balanceto the user.
    runs for all incentive model.
]
Section 1.1[
    ONCHAIN vs OFFCHAIN (hybrid approach)
    a. Offchain processes: 
        *backend handles frequent interactions(e.g logins, likes, purchases) and calculates the user's reward points.
        * points are stored in a database and associated with the user's account.
    b. onchain redemption: 
        *when a user wants to redeem their tokens, the backend sends a transaction to a smart contract. 
        *The smart contract validates the redemption request(e.g, checks the user's point balance) and mints the token to the user's wallet.
    c. onchain Auditability:
        *periodcially, the backend can batch-process interaction data and send it to the blockchainfor transparency and Auditability. 
        *e.g at the end of each day, the backend submits a summary of all interactions to a smart contract, which stores the data on-chain.
    Optimization:

]
Section 1.1[
    SDK user ineraction:
    a. Link dev collects the user id and intercation data (login, purchases) in their application and send it to the API
    Link dev database:
    the link dev updates the user's token balance in their own database by adding the token earned to the existing balance.
    maybe in future with a robust database the user will be handled by me so the dev only have to paste.... once....
    POINT OF INTERACTION WITH USER:
    a. this will happen during the (on-chain) interact with the sytem via thier wallet. after that we get to have the user wallet stored with us. their link to link3
        i. wallet  dynamic(any wallet can claim) ii. static wallet after one wallet is linked the have to be used for that token balance forever
    nb: until the token redemtion your backend only interacts with the developer's system.
]



Section 1.3[
    token creation- 
    1. manual approval(fast & simple for mvp)
        a. projects submit an application via a form
        b. admin manually review & approve them
        c. approved projects get an API key to launch tokens

    2.Staking based Approval(Decentralized and Scalable)
        a. projects stake a certain amount of sei tokens
        b. Staking unlocks access to the token launch Features
        c. if project misuses the system their stake is slashed.
    3. On-chain voting (Community-governed)
        a. existing verified projects vote, they're approved.
        b. if a project gets enough votes, they're approved.
    MVP - is manual.

section 1.1[
    Rotating hash keys for privacy and user control.
    First Interaction:

       1. Client sends user_id, action_type (no hash_key)
        System creates a new user with a hash_key
        System returns new hash_key with reward
        Subsequent Interactions:

       2. Client sends user_id, action_type, and hash_key from previous interaction
        System validates the hash_key, finds the user
        System generates a new hash_key, stores the old one in rotation history
        System returns new hash_key with reward
        Privacy Benefits:

       3. You never store actual user IDs from client systems
        Hash keys expire and rotate, adding security
        Even if database is compromised, can't map users to their original IDs
        Added Security:

       4. Hash keys embed timestamps to prevent reuse
        Each interaction generates a new hash key
        Previous hash keys expire after a set period
        data given to us: neededhash(if empty create a new)>>>> data sent back>>>>> hash + reward 
        client integration(added the has to the user.... on the database table so it can be quried.)

Section 1.3 [
    Utility Coin culture
    a. Utility coins for credible organization.
        i. only verified and credible organizations can create tokens.
        ii. the tokens are tied to the organization's reputation and Utility, makingbthem more stable and valuable.
    b. In house B2B transactions:
        i. Since all tokens exist within the same ecosystem, organizations can use them for B2B transactions 
        (e.g., exchanging services or goods) without needing external intermediaries.
    c. comunity incentivization:
        i. the organization community (e.g., customers, users, employees) can earn token as reward for theri engagement or contributions.
        ii. this creates a shareholding-like system, where the community enefits from the organization's sucess.
    d. automated token creation:
        i. the proces of creating tokens for organizations should be automated, with parameters collected formthe organization to ensure credibility and proper governance.
    Token Creation Process:
    a. parameters to collect from the organization:
        i. organization nama
        ii. organization type
        iii. purpose of the token
        iv. initial supply
        v. Token distribution
        vi. Wallet address
        vii. Governance rules
        viii. Community incentives.
        ix. B2B Use cases. 
    b. Tokencreation workflow
        i. application Submission:
        ii. verification
        iii. Smart contract deployment
        vi. Token distribution
        v. Governance setup
        vi. community incentivization
        vii. B2B integration
        viii. Smart contract design
    c. Smart contract design
        i. Token minting
        ii. Token distribution
        iii. Governance
        vi. Community Reward
        v. B2b transactions
    SHAREHOLDING SYSTEM:
    a. profit sharing: allow token holders voting rights on key decisions.
    b. voting right: token holders votingright on key decisions
    c. Staking rewards: allow token holders to stake their tokenn and earn rewards over time
    d. Community growth: reward community fir bringinh in new users or contributing to the organization's sucess
